[Substrate](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/substrate/index.html) is a modular
framework that enables you to create domain-specific blockchains by composing custom or pre-built
components. It is part of the [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk), and is
responsible for providing the tools needed to build blockchain **runtimes**.

:::info Substrate is part of the Polkadot SDK (monorepo)

As of August, 2023, the **Polkadot**, **Substrate**, and **Cumulus** codebases were merged into one
monorepo. Now referred to as the [**Polkadot SDK**](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk),
this monorepo represents all the primary tools needed to build blockchains using Substrate.

The _Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities (**FRAME**)_ is a set of modules and
support libraries that simplify runtime development within Substrate. In Substrate, these modules
are called **pallets**, each hosting domain-specific logic to include in a chain's runtime.

Substrate may be utilized to create a solo chain or a parachain for a relay chain like Polkadot or
Kusama. At its core, it is a set of Rust libraries that provide the most basic primitives and
protocols to implement a distributed, peer-to-peer state machine, such as a blockchain.

:::info An analogy: React, the library for web and native user interfaces

Another way to think about Substrate is similar to how a web developer may use/think about
**React**. Where React provides core libraries for manipulating the elements of the DOM via
developer-defined components, Substrate also provides the base libraries and primitives needed to
create a blockchain. It was designed to not be opinionated via a highly generic codebase, enabling
high customizability.

## Substrate's Libraries

Substrate, as mentioned, is a collection of Rust crates that define a generic way to implement a
blockchain. Although you will only use a few of these libraries directly in this course, know that
everything you use is built upon them.

You will encounter two primary prefixes when developing with Substrate crates: `sc-` (**Substrate
Client**) and `sp-` (**Substrate Primitive**). Crates prefixed with `sc-` usually refer to
network-related functionalities, such as peer-to-peer networking or consensus. The `sp-` prefix
usually indicates that the library provides primitives for a particular aspect of Substrate, such as
runtime-related primitives.

A few significant crates that you will encounter are:

- [`sp_runtime`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sp_runtime/index.html) - Runtime
  modules shared primitive types
- [`sp_core`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sp_core/index.html) - Shareable
  Substrate types
- [`sp_io`](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sp_io/index.html) - I/O host interface for
  substrate runtime. Substrate runtime standard library as compiled when linked with Rustâ€™s standard
  library.

These, along with many more, all pertain to building certain aspects of distributed systems,
including but not limited to:

- Consensus mechanisms
- Peer-to-peer networking
- Fork-choice rules
- Block authoring
- State management

## A Brief Introduction to FRAME (Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities)

```

A common question is: _If Substrate exists, what is FRAME for? Why is it mentioned so often?_.

FRAME, or Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities, is another abstraction on top
of Substrate. It introduces a set of conventions and structures for building a blockchain with
Substrate through numerous Rust macros. These macros enable the powerful and trivial to use a system
of **pallets** to construct **runtimes** using Substrate. A **runtime**, also called a **state
transition function (STF)**, defines the state transitions for a particular blockchain.

:::info

As we advance, terminologies such as **pallets**, and custom bundles of business logic that make up
a runtime will be expected. If a term here is unfamiliar and undefined, reference the glossary.

:::

Remember, a state machine is the core concept of a blockchain. FRAME facilitates the way for state
to propagate and change in a more developer-friendly way.

The outcome of developing on Substrate, particularly FRAME, is almost always a **runtime** (compiled
to WebAssembly, or Wasm), also called a **state transition function (STF)**. This runtime defines
the core logic that determines how state propagates and changes in a blockchain. In the coming
lessons, you will learn more about how a runtime works and eventually dive deeper into its
structure.
