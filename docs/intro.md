# Introduction - The Cookbook

Welcome to the Polkadot Cookbook.  This repository aims to be a resource to show how one can practically use the Polkadot tech stack to build real, useful things.  In reality, you can build a lot using web3 technologies, however, they may not always be as straightforward as a "web2" or traditional application.

## Install

Before starting anything, be sure to install all necessary dependencies, which you can find [here](./install.md).

## Your First Chain - The Quickstart

If you want to dive right into engineering your own rollups using the Polkadot SDK, [head over to the quickstart!](./quickstart.md)
