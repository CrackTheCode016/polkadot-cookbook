### Installation

```bash

### Local Development

```bash
$ yarn start

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
